# Dart-Revision

### What is The Mobile Development?
- The Process of making a software for smartphones, tablets and digital assistants for both Android and IOS Operating Systems.

#### There are many frameworks available
- Android using Java/Kotlin as a programming language.
- IOS using Objective-C/Swift as a programming language.

#### Mobile Application for Business (making a application for different OSs)

- Developing an application for both OSs.
- Code in two different languages using two different frameworks.
  - but it budgeting and time, to overcome this problem (complexity) there exist a mobile frameworks supporting both OSs (cross-platform).

### What is the difference between Native and Cross-platform Applications?

> **Native Applications**
>1. Different Codebases
>1. Higher Cost
>1. Fast and Responsive
>1. Long Development time
>1. interact with device's sensors
>1. can be used offline

> **Cross-platform(Hybrid) Applications**
>1. Single Codebase
>1. Less Cost and time
>1. Faster build times and time to market
>1. Can have slower performance
>1. Easy integration with Web-based services
>1. limited or no access to device sensors
>1. can lead to poor UX

### Cross platforms frameworks
1. Ionic
    - A complete open-source SDK mobile applications.
    - built on top of AngularJS & Apache Cordova

2. Xamarin
    - A Microsoft-owned software company founded in May 2011
    - A platform that lets developers build one app that works on multiple platforms in C#

3. React Native
    - In 2015, by Facebook
    - An open-source project based on a JavaScript engine.
    - React Native allows you to program your user interfaces (UI) in one language (JavaScript) that orchestrates native UI controls at runtime.

4. **Flutter**
    - A simple and high performance framework based on *Dart Language*
    - An open-source mobile application development SDK created by Google for building high-performance cross platform native mobile applications for Android and iOS

### Dart
- A client-optimized programming language for apps on multiple platforms
- It is developed by Google and is used to build mobile, desktop, server, and web applications.

#### IDEs For Dart
> 1. DartPad
> 1. VS Code
> 1. Android Studio

## **Flutter** 
-   **Offers many ready to use widgets (UI) to create a modern application.**
-   **Flutter Widgets also support animation and gesture.**

#### Flutter Compatibility
-   Android: Jellybean or newer
-   iPhone: iOS 8 or newer

#### Flutter Advantages and Dis Advantages
**Advantages**
1. Dart has a large repository of software packages which lets you to extend the capabilities of your application
1. Developers need to write just a single code base for both applications (both Android and iOS platforms).
1. Flutter may to be extended to other platform as well in the future.
1. Flutter needs lesser testing. Because of its single code base it is sufficient if we write automated tests once for both the platforms.
1. Flutterâ€™s simplicity makes it a good candidate for fast development. Its customization capability and extendibility makes it even more powerful.
1. With Flutter, developers has full control over the widgets and its layout.
1. Flutter offers great developer tools, with amazing hot reload

**Dis Advantages** 
1. Coded in Dart language, a developer needs to learn new language.
1. Modern framework tries to separate logic and UI
1. Flutter, user interface and logic is intermixed.
    - We can overcome this using high level module to separate user interface and logic.
